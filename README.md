# $\mathrm{\LaTeX}$ memory Sheet
A template for creating memory sheet permitted in exams with customizable grids (for me, I wanted 0.25Â cm grids)

You might want to turn off page numbers or the credits, if your printer doesn't support borderless printing.

I recommend these pens for writing on the sheet, as they are the smallest I could find (no this is not an affiliate link): https://amzn.eu/d/hPTl6ck

Here is a preview of the template, with watermark, page numbers and credits turned on:

Here is an example I used during an actual exam:

Nowadays, I also like to use colors, to make the sheet more readable and to make it easier to find things.
